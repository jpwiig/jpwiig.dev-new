## Badge

If you want to you can display a bagde on your website, from me to you! 
A type of automatic delevery system for updates for the bagde is planned, in the meantime you can navigate to

`js/badge/wiigen-badge.js`
Or go to path in the repo [here](https://github.com/jpwiig/jpwiig.dev-new/blob/master/js/badge/wiigen-bagde.js)

Download the JS file or copy it, whatever you prefer
the badge is depeneded on a monospace font!

if everything is done correctly, its just to: 

```html 
<wiigen-badge></wiigen-badge>
<script src="../where/you/put/it/wiigen-badge.js"></script>
```
